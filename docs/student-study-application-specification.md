# Project Specification: Smart Study Assistant

## Project Overview
Smart Study Assistant is a web-based application designed to help students study more effectively by automatically generating practice questions from their uploaded notes. The project serves dual purposes: (1) as a portfolio showcase piece demonstrating technical skills to potential employers, and (2) as a potential source of modest income generation.

## Core Functionality
The application will allow students to upload their study materials in various formats, and then use advanced language processing to generate relevant practice questions based on the content. Students can customize question types, track their progress, and focus on specific topics within their study materials.

## Target Users
- Primary: Students at all educational levels
- Secondary: Educational institutions, tutors, or teachers who want to create practice materials
